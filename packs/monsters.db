Being trained as guerilla fighters, Scoia’tael travel in groups called ‘commandos’ and lay ambushes for their prey. When traveling through dense wilderness in the North, always keep an eye out in the trees and bushes. Oftentimes Scoia’tael commandos will track prey for a few hours until they come to a good ambush spot.When they do attack, Scoia’tael will usually begin their ambush with a barrage of arrows from the forest line. With the first barrage fired, half of the unit will switch to their falchions and charge, sometimes screaming a battle cry such as “Aelirren!” or “Sherrawedd!”, that calls back to the great elven hero Aelirren and the place of her death, Sherrawedd Palace. While the melee group engages you, the other half of the commando will stay back, firing into the melee. Scoia’tael who are too far for melee and within 10m or so will often throw knives at the nearest target. The best way to fight Scoia’tael archers is to have cover. If you have a cart or caravan, get behind it (or better yet inside it) and force them to come to you. Try your best to stay out of the archer’s line of sight and deal with the melee fighters first.

Your average golem was created by a mage for defense or manual labor, or perhaps to guard something important. A golem takes its orders and follows them to the letter. Forever. A golem told to guard a vase will do so until  it dies, which may be centuries (or even millennia) later. This also means a golem told to fetch water from a well will continue to fetch bucket after bucket until it is told to stop. Golems aren’t creative, but they are very persistent. You face a golem for one of three reasons. Reason one: you need something that a powerful mage doesn’t want you to get. In this case at least the golem is stationary–you’ll have time to plan ahead and prepare. Reason two: you are attacking a mage and said mage has a golem. Once again, at least you’ll have time to plan ahead. Reason three: a mage has created a golem specifically to kill you. This is the worst case. It will chase you ‘til the day you die, and probably dig up your corpse to check that you’re really dead. It might even give your corpse a few bone-shattering punches just to make sure. \n                                                                                                                                                            If you have to fight a golem, stock up on dimeritium bombs. While they won’t ‘shut off’ a golem, they will make it sluggish. Elementa oil is also good, as are spells that incorporate electricity. When struck by enough electricity a golem will freeze up as its magical bonds try to reassert themselves. Neverblock or parry a golem–their fists are so strong that they stand a good chance of shattering any weapon. Since they’re constructs you can also forget bleeding wounds, poison, mind-affecting spells, or fire. Lastly but possibly most important, if you see a golem charging at you...don’t be what it hits.","monsterLoreSkillValue":14,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+8","punch":{"value":"1d6+8"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+12"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/golem.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Golems","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/golem.png","tint":"","width":3,"height":3,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"9tkF1vdyQ315OBjK","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"jXv45OfOol3omil4","name":"Vulnerability: Electricity ","type":"note","data":{"description":"Golems are vulnerable to electricity, which may disrupt them.

People can usually agree, if ya wanna get rid of a wraith ya gotta perform a ritual. First, find the corpse, which won’t have rotted, mind ya.

A specter is the spirit of someone who died either in terrible circumstances or with unfinished business. That being said, you can’t banish a specter via the method written above. Most specters must be killed and sent back to the realm of the dead. But those tied to a curse must have the curse lifted to move on permanently. Wraiths are technically sentient, but very few act on this sentience. Most wraiths are consumed  by hatred and will lash out randomly at anything that comes near. The remaining 5% or so retain some of their sentience and may speak and interact. Usually these sentient specters are part of a grand curse.\n                                                                                        When fighting a specter, keep moving all the time. They will swing widely with their sword and lantern and use their  selectively incorporeal nature to ‘dodge’ attacks. Every once in a while a specter will teleport, usually to get behind a target and attack. This is the specter’s most dangerous move, since they literally come out of nowhere. If you catch a specter with a Yrden Sign or a moondust bomb, you can keep it from turning incorporeal or teleporting. That and an application of specter oil will really shorten your fight.\n                                                                                        No one knows where a wraith’s conciousness goes when they are destroyed; it has been argued for centuries.","monsterLoreSkillValue":10,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+0","punch":{"value":"1d6+0"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+4"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/wraith.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/Wraith","displayName":0,"img":"spectre.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"CDT9Cg9xTA0o2iql","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"wbLq5ihZA1AUw7F2","name":"Wraith sword","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"S/P","isMelee":true,"accuracy":0,"avail":"Common","damage":"3d6","reliable":15,"hands":"1","range":"N/A","effect":"","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":1},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.OhGYEgIvEUfGDxK2"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"0oUkbsZB9dDLfWd4","name":"Wraith lantern","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":2.5,"cost":270,"type":"S/P","isMelee":true,"accuracy":0,"avail":"Common","damage":"2d6+2","reliable":15,"hands":"1","range":"N/A","effect":"Fire (25%)","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":1},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.OhGYEgIvEUfGDxK2"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"tEQPYnhGaEZ6Mc8K","name":"Essence of Wraith (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":95,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Wraiths","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"aether"},"sort":300000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.UYylJWbhqduU57C8"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"NF7JczbjnLCD1uLE","name":"Specter Dust (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":30,"type":"substances","rarity":"Poor","location":"Wraiths","quantityObtainable":"1d6","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"fulgur"},"sort":700000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.JKB9S66VMhu0j6Xh"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"db5cXauAnbm9up1H","name":"Infused Dust (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":146,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Wraiths, Griffin and Golems","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"hydragenum"},"sort":300000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.RE8TQemmK5OPBQSn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

When you go out in swamp-lands and flood plains you risk running into large groups of endrega. When fighting these beasts, keep in mind that all endrega can pounce 4m from a standing start. A chasm or a wall may not save you. Endrega of all forms are immune to poisons thanks to the highly toxic nature of their  bodies, and can resist slashing weapons thanks to their  hard  outer  shells. Before hunting endrega, stock up on anything good against poison, such as golden oriole potions. Nearing a nest, you’ll probably run across workers first– the most common form of endrega. Keep moving and avoid getting boxed in. Worker endrega claws are mild-ly poisonous. Not too bad fighting one on one, but terrible if you’re surrounded by five or six. Survive 8-9 workers and you’ll start seeing warriors. Warrior endrega are the meaner, more dangerous cousins of the simple workers. They are incredibly aggressive and will attack constantly with their poisonous tail, leaping after a target when it gets out of range. Once you’re on top of the nest you’ll meet endrega drones. These drones exist to fight and fertilize their queen. They are the most aggressive endrega, and attack on sight with no provocation at all. Drones will start by launching a barrage of poisonous quills from their abdomen before pouncing with their pincers. Since only the strongest drone can fertilize the queen, drones are always look-ing  for  a  fight.  Past  all  of  these hazards you’ll find the queen and her eggs. If you make it to this point, you’ll have to avoid not only the queen but also all other endrega in the area.

Ungodly necromancers who raise the dead and’ll summon demons to take over your body. There are few places in the world that people still respect  mages these days. A real shame. Few years ago mages were the most respected folk in the land.","commonSkillValue":12,"monsterLore":"It’s not very likely that you’ll ever fight a mage. Most of them are reasonably peaceful people who are more likely to hire a  mercenary or an assassin to kill you. However, if you do wind up fighting a mage to escape an experiment, stop a crime, or just because you feel like it know that distance is not your friend. At range, a mage can throw a tremendous amount of power at you. Close range combat is a far better bet. Most mages practice less at melee combat then they do at spell casting. Their melee weapons are also less damaging and more prone to breaking. Keeping in melee range with a mage takes work they are prone to teleport if you get too close to them. \n                                                                                                                                                                                        The first thing you should do when fighting a mage is disarm them or destroy their staff. Without a staff a mage expends more energy per spell and wears out much faster. A mage drained of magic must damage their body to cast more spells or else take a turn to rest. That’s your best opportunity. Mages rarely wear armor, so killing an exhausted mage doesn’t take much. Since mages are usually very intel-ligent, they typically realize when they are beat and give up. However, if you shame a mage enough the mage will fight until the end. Mages prefer life in large cities, but with the Witch Hunts you may also run into one who’s hiding out.","monsterLoreSkillValue":16,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+0","punch":{"value":"1d6+0"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+4"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/Mages.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Bandit","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/mage1.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"GbxblSsa9tnibq86","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"K9FZ7dYB9roqrjk8","name":"Dagger","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"Daggers come in all kinds of shapes and sizes  but  they’re  always  small  enough  to  hide.

They are actually of a species from another dimension that acts much like other animals. Ghouls are scavengers who feed on corpses left behind at battlefields, though they will attack fresh prey if it wanders by. You’ll usually find ghouls in small packs that often fight over food once danger has passed. When fighting ghouls, always watch your back. They will attack together and try to surround you, staggering their attacks to flank you and darting back. Single  one ghoul out and attack it exclusively, to shave down the number of ghouls attacking. Keep in mind that ghouls can pounce from 5m away. Small chasms, short walls and the like are much less effective against ghouls than their slower necrophage bretheren. When in melee combat, a ghoul strikes with its claws, but if it grapples a target (or the target is otherwise hindered) it may bite the target to cause a bleeding wound.\n                                                                                                    If you knock a ghoul below 10 Health Points, it will enter a fury. In this fury the ghoul attacks rabidly and its wounds quickly close. Kill the ghoul quickly to keep it from regenerating its health. It’s also vital to reposition often so the ghouls can’t gang up on you and get bonuses to attack. \n                                                                                                    If you are fighting as a party, stand back to back so the ghouls can’t easily get into your back arc.If you need to lure a group of ghouls out of an area, it’s best to start by exhuming any buried bodies. Once exhumed, the bodies should be moved to draw the ghouls away.","monsterLoreSkillValue":10,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+0","punch":{"value":"1d6+0"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+4"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/ghoul.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Ghoul","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/goule.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"I5CpNFMXUTH1uIMD","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"zfCNnZWo6PijlKNT","name":"Pounce","type":"note","data":{"description":"The creature doesn’t need to take a running start when leaping."},"sort":200001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.JfBUarlaHTTHxwFt"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"LWM2lRr0G7iaLjpA","name":"Fury","type":"note","data":{"description":"When ghouls are brought below 10 HP they enter a fury in which they move every round, attack every round, and regenerate 3 points of damage per turn."},"sort":300001,"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"DBgF4Dr1KwNWspRT","name":"Night Vision","type":"note","data":{"description":"The crature can operate in areas of dim light with no penalties."},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.AIRerIzhFcOxqlo6"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"2ZMyajcd774Aqd0S","name":"Feral","type":"note","data":{"description":"For the purposes of Awareness and Wilderness Survival, instinct gives them an INT of 6."},"sort":300001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.V335z5M1sivK1JOE"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"WNko1CJs4TNkPSAM","name":"Claws","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"S/P","isMelee":true,"accuracy":0,"avail":"Everywhere","damage":"3d6","reliable":0,"hands":"1","range":"","effect":"","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":1},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.XEHe0F5DwUCFBCyn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"xmSErQlB4AJ4f3Wf","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"P","isMelee":true,"accuracy":null,"avail":"Everywhere","damage":"3d6+2","reliable":0,"hands":"1","range":"","effect":"Bleed (25%), -1 ACC","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":1},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.UvG2EEAKSQDjGW8M"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"osgHt7i0uDcvHTzz","name":"Ghool Marrow (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"cost":80,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Ghouls","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"quebrith"},"sort":400000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.jJaiLdol1KK1xI5i"}},"img":"quebrith.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"BnVkiPyHjP3Ia9Nn","name":"Ghoul  Claw (2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":1,"cost":60,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Ghouls","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"vitriol"},"sort":500000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.oQG9kzvBNPjgus4G"}},"img":"vitriol.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"2RulQm9KqQJg6vny","name":"Venom Extract (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":38,"type":"substances","rarity":"Poor","location":"Ghouls, grave hags, Endrega, arachasae, wyverns","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"caelum"},"sort":800000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.78hAe85gNogr1BBs"}},"img":"caelum.png","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

These wraiths are powerful, dangerous, and vindictive creatures. The souls of the women are driven mad with pain and anger that compels them to stalk the fields and lands around their grave, searching for the person that killed them. That’s fair, but they have a tendency to kill anything else that gets too close to them as well. When dealing with a noonwraith, you have to be quick: engaging the creature in melee combat is a necessity. Noonwraiths are incorporeal until you catch them in a Yrden circle or a moondust bomb. This is your only window for physical attacks. You should also engage a noonwraith close to sunset, as moonlight weakens the creature.\n                                                                                                                                                                        Noonwraiths usually attack with their deadly claws. From time to time they use magic to sweep up a dust devil and blind a challenging target. If damaged too much, they begin a high noon dance, creating copies of themselves that drain your HP and heal the noonwraith. Destroy these copies immediately, before they can siphon too much health from you. Your best chance to fight a noonwraith is to coat your blade in specter oil and attempt to summon it at night. Find something of great value to the wraith in its previous life and burn it near the grave site. 90% of the time this will summon the wraith, and with the moon high in the sky you will have a much easier time killing it. Once killed, the specter’s soul is released from the shackles of pain that kept it in this world. It is put to rest and can move on to whatever lies beyond the veil of death.

They stalk the swamps and flood plains of the Continent, primarily along the Pontar and the Yaruga, and they apply a sort of camouflage to hide their entire massive body from sight. However this camouflage isn’t magical. An arachas hides its body inside a hollowed-out log or giant shell that matches the environment it lives in. Arachasae are perfectly capable of seeing you if you stand still, and doing so will make you a perfect target. Hunting arachasae prefer to sneak up as close as they can while camouflaged and then pounce on their prey. If the prey notices the arachas and runs, it will shoot sticky webbing at the target to immobilize it before pouncing. Once locked in melee combat an arachas will try to claw the oppo-nent to death, often blocking attacks with its hard pincers and trying to pin their opponent.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            When fighting an arachas, apply something to help fight poison, such as gold oriole potion. It’s also good to load up on insectoid oil and, when possible, stay behind the arachas. Arachas back armor is always the weakest—a  well placed strike to the back will usually penetrate. It’s also good to position yourself so a pouncing arachas may plummet off of drops or ram hard objects and take damage. Arachasae are often confused with endrega queens. An endrega queen is so similar to an arachas that many academics believe the two species may be related, with many thinking that arachasae mutated from endrega. The best way to distinguish an arachas from an endrega queen is their location. Arachasae are solitary predators and can be found alone in the wilderness. Endrega queens are found in their nest, surrounded by other endrega.","monsterLoreSkillValue":16,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+8","punch":{"value":"1d6+8"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+12"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/arachasae.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Arachasae","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/arachas.png","tint":"","width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"KYN1MsoUNWKn1yY1","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"3XmK32bnRej1LhC4","name":"Vulnerability: Soft Spot","type":"note","data":{"description":"An arachas’ back has only 10 points of armor and does not have its damage resistances."},"sort":300001,"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Cin6xogoY9YJKEKi","name":"Claws","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"S/P","isMelee":true,"accuracy":0,"avail":"Everywhere","damage":"5d6","reliable":0,"hands":"1","range":"","effect":"Poison (25%)","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":"2"},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.XEHe0F5DwUCFBCyn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"gxj2N3fbCkVhPz2Q","name":"Arachas Venom (1d6)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"cost":76,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Arachasae","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"caelum"},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.qrmlKEAjonVTXyd5"}},"img":"caelum.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Y3X4YAOUKlKoLuCD","name":"Venom Extract (1d6)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":38,"type":"substances","rarity":"Poor","location":"Ghouls, grave hags, Endrega, arachasae, wyverns","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"caelum"},"sort":800000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.78hAe85gNogr1BBs"}},"img":"caelum.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"TK8D6GyvurzUDsXP","name":"Arachas Eyes (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"cost":95,"type":"substances","rarity":"Poor","location":"Arachasae","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"fulgur"},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.kGYmdjwX3pXJ6U1c"}},"img":"fulgur.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"2EzYvfnBb7VZtfLX","name":"Chitin (1d6)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":5,"cost":106,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"arachasae & endrega","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"vermilion"},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.uxYinv8UPJJNiWpB"}},"img":"vermilion.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"wY2G2vnaU28MkQqh","name":"Pounce","type":"note","data":{"description":"The creature doesn’t need to take a running start when leaping."},"sort":200001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.JfBUarlaHTTHxwFt"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bZHgUhy5WsxGISY0","name":"Camouflage","type":"note","data":{"description":"Arachasae have a +10 to Stealth in their home terrain when they aren’t moving."},"sort":900000,"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"PCKXOIv7W5SwIEMY","name":"Webbing","type":"note","data":{"description":"If an enemy gets more than 8m from the arachas, it will shoot webbing at a range of 10m with Athletics.

They are short, ugly, bald creatures that tend to hide in holes and caves but will live just about anywhere. They will hunt down anything made of meat that has a heartbeat and devour it from the top of its head to the tip of its toes. This obviously makes them a danger to the world at large, and thus most witchers kill them with no great misgivings. However, nekkers have recently been discovered to be far more intelligent than most give them credit for. They hunt in war bands led by a chieftain, they wear loin cloths and headdresses, sometimes carry staves, and in some places even decorate their caves with primitive paintings commemorating battles and hunts that they have gone on. All of this being said, they are still a threat to humanity and other sentient creatures.If you have to fight a group of nekkers (which you likely will if you travel the war-torn roads in the Northern Kingdoms) keep in mind that nekkers are pack hunters who take orders from a chieftain, and killing it should be a priority. The chieftain will usually wear a skull headdress and carry a staff of some kind. Nekkers will try to gang up on you, so stay moving constantly. Area of effect or cone-based attacks, such as spells or bombs, are good to thin the ranks of the nekkers. Ogroid oil applied to a blade is also a good idea if you have some to hand. Technically, nekkers are somewhat intelligent–with great difficulty you might be able to convince them to leave you alone if you show them more fruitful prey. In general, it’s not a great plan to stake your life on your diplomacy, though.","monsterLoreSkillValue":10,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"-2","punch":{"value":"1d6+-2"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+2"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/Nekkers.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Nekkers","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/nekker_guerrier1.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":0.7,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"PSTtpBDEHKC3uqDl","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"o0In2s7Bc2CZy1oN","name":"Leader ","type":"note","data":{"description":"Often, a group of nekkers will be lead by a nekker chieftain.

While you can block and parry, it is more advisable to keep maneuvering around the fiend. Relict oil can be tremendously useful when fighting a fiend, as well as moondust bombs to keep it from regenerating for a time and dimeritium  bombs to stop the fiend’s hypnosis.

Interestingly enough, grave hags appear exclusively femalea male hag has never been seen. Most books state that grave hags, like some other monsters, steal little girls from villages to transform into new hags. A few, though, suggest that grave hags are not actually female as such, but hermaphroditic. \n                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                What we do know is that grave hags are ambush predators that live near graveyards and other sources of rotten corpses. They are perfectly content to eat carrion, but will attack fresh prey if given the chance. When on the attack a grave hag will close the distance at tremendous speed and attack with its scything claws. If the target falls back to recover, the grave hag will use its poisonous tongue like a barbed whip to weaken the prey. The grave hag’s tongue can be sliced off with a successful parry with a bladed weapon. The safest ways to engage a grave hag are to keep distance or stock up on necrophage oil and get in close with a shielding spell or the Quen Sign. Grave hags can be reasoned with, but are incredibly stubborn and prone to attack immediately. If you must fight a grave hag in its home, check first for a magical skull circle or other necrophages it’s bent to its will.

They are short, ugly, bald creatures that tend to hide in holes and caves but will live just about anywhere. They will hunt down anything made of meat that has a heartbeat and devour it from the top of its head to the tip of its toes. This obviously makes them a danger to the world at large, and thus most witchers kill them with no great misgivings. However, nekkers have recently been discovered to be far more intelligent than most give them credit for. They hunt in war bands led by a chieftain, they wear loin cloths and headdresses, sometimes carry staves, and in some places even decorate their caves with primitive paintings commemorating battles and hunts that they have gone on. All of this being said, they are still a threat to humanity and other sentient creatures.If you have to fight a group of nekkers (which you likely will if you travel the war-torn roads in the Northern Kingdoms) keep in mind that nekkers are pack hunters who take orders from a chieftain, and killing it should be a priority. The chieftain will usually wear a skull headdress and carry a staff of some kind. Nekkers will try to gang up on you, so stay moving constantly. Area of effect or cone-based attacks, such as spells or bombs, are good to thin the ranks of the nekkers. Ogroid oil applied to a blade is also a good idea if you have some to hand. Technically, nekkers are somewhat intelligent–with great difficulty you might be able to convince them to leave you alone if you show them more fruitful prey.

The vast majority of bandits are soldiers without an army, mercenaries who have no contract, or deserters from any one of the many armies flooding across the land. Simple sorts, bandits. The front ranks will charge with long swords. Any who can’t will draw their crossbows. Bandits are usually looking for three things: safety, money, and something to take their anger out on. They aren’t exactly easy to deal with but, unlike most monsters, they can be reasoned with. Maybe you can convince them not to try and kill you. Since they aren’t hunting on instinct bandits will likely give up if you do enough damage to them.However, some who travel in more tightly woven groups may fight all the harder if you kill their buddies. In the war-torn North, be a bit more wary. Lack of easily accessible food has driven some bandits to cannibalism.

Just to avoid ‘em.","commonSkillValue":14,"monsterLore":"Griffins are technically very simple creatures. They operate a lot like a combination between the two beasts that make them up: lions and eagles. Unfortunately, combining lions and eagles effectively creates a super-predator. Griffins are fast on the ground and fast in the sky. They can cross large areas of difficult terrain by flying over it and spot hiding prey with eagle eyes. That doesn’t even take into account how they pick up prey the size of a horse and drop it from 100 meters in the air. Luckily, griffins mostly just attack intruders in their territory. The problem is that with war leaving corpses all over the open fields and valleys, griffins are moving their territories from the high mountains to the low peaks and foothills. Suddenly, small villages at the foot of the mountains  are in a griffin’s territory without even realizing it.\n                                                                                                                                                                If you have to fight a griffin, do yourself a favor and stock up on ranged ammunition and hybrid oil. You’ll need  the  ammunition because griffins like to attack from the air, swooping down on their opponents. A direct hit with a crossbow bolt, spear, arrow, or other ranged weapon forces the griffin to re-adjust in the air. If it fails, it will plummet to the ground, take falling damage, and be more vulnerable. On the ground you have to watch out for the griffin’s razor-sharp claws. Not only will they tear you open, they leave vast bleed-ing wounds. If you get too far from a griffin it’ll close distance with a charge: a tremendously powerful but inaccurate attack, easier to dodge than the normal claw attacks, but a hit will spell doom for the average man. The last thing to watch for is the griffin’s sonic cry. Fail to resist that and you’ll be a sitting duck.","monsterLoreSkillValue":14,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+0","punch":{"value":"1d6+0"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+0"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/griffin.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Griffin","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/griffin.png","tint":"","width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"laMTRiUzjqJCs0W0","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"CCoi68OQsgu8g1zY","name":"Claws","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"S/P","isMelee":true,"accuracy":0,"avail":"Everywhere","damage":"6d6","reliable":0,"hands":"1","range":"","effect":"","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":2},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.XEHe0F5DwUCFBCyn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"AYMl4rf9047Q3rck","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"P","isMelee":true,"accuracy":null,"avail":"Everywhere","damage":"7d6+2","reliable":0,"hands":"1","range":"","effect":"Bleed (50%)","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":1},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.UvG2EEAKSQDjGW8M"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"X8uyXSumwhCSkfpP","name":"Griffin Feather (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":148,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Griffins","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"vermilion"},"sort":400000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Bt6bTr4hJhLE6bNv"}},"img":"vermilion.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"YSRLlA0FMjEvZnFv","name":"Infused Dust","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":146,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Wraiths, Griffin and Golems","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"hydragenum"},"sort":300000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.RE8TQemmK5OPBQSn"}},"img":"hydragenum.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"8DUGEGEuROtcJ08Q","name":"Griffin Egg (1d6/2)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":1,"cost":150,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Griffin","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"vermilion"},"sort":300000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.kXxeM5LeMlIZPtWU"}},"img":"vermilion.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"ddPuLh7uSNvg3MNd","name":"Sonic Screech","type":"note","data":{"description":"A griffin can take its turn to let out a screech which forces anyone within 10m to make a Stun save at -1."},"sort":500000,"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"OnUwedStbcdg6z7o","name":"Charge","type":"note","data":{"description":"If a target moves more than 10m away from the griffin, it can charge and make a powerful claw attack at -4 which does 10d6 damage and knocks the target back 8m.

Lesser vampires are quick and agile, stronger than the average man, stealthy as a shadow, and vicious in their attacks. But they are animalistic–often less than fully sentient. At the opposite on the spectrum, the power of a nosferat is so vast as to be almost incomparable. Katakan are a good midway point in the vampire family between bestial lesser vampires and overwhelming, brilliant higher vampires. Katakans are intelligent creatures, often more so than the average human. They are highly magical, able to hide from all forms of magical scanning including witcher medallions and other  divination, and can communicate with prey telepathically.  They cannot take any form but their own. In combat they are stealthy, hiding behind magical invisibility while they drive their prey mad with telepathic fear tactics. Katakan are hard to kill, regenerating from most wounds very quickly and dancing around attacks with their superior speed. They are still more animalistic than their more powerful cousins and are prone to lick blood off the cobblestones after eviscerating their prey with their claws. Popularly-known protections do not work on a katakan. Most will probably just annoy it, save for the stake through the heart. When fighting a katakan, fire is your best weapon since they are very flammable. Black blood can also be quite useful if the katakan tries to bite and feed on you. Alternatively, remember that any drug or amount of alcohol in your blood will affect a vampire that bites you.","monsterLoreSkillValue":17,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+2","punch":{"value":"1d6+2"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+6"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/katakan.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Katakan","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/katakan.png","tint":"","width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"mlWmkzbwE6Y3A0tj","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"chksAZRsCJnpN65W","name":"Vulnerability: Celestial Weakness","type":"note","data":{"description":"In sunlight, a katakan’s regen-eration is lowered to 3."},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"khawJIGjBcVNNi57","name":"Vulnerability: Blood Transference","type":"note","data":{"description":"Katakan are affected by any substances in the blood they drink."},"sort":200000,"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"8CaUHlQigtaRXt0J","name":"Regeneration","type":"note","data":{"description":"The creature regenerates 5 point of damage per round."},"sort":400001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.kTAHvjKaKBtkXSab"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"MKsL121QVY50t1i8","name":"Night Vision","type":"note","data":{"description":"The crature can operate in areas of dim light with no penalties."},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.AIRerIzhFcOxqlo6"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"6d2IoB7h2oQpNRRZ","name":"Invisibility","type":"note","data":{"description":"A katakan can become invisible, granting it +10 to stealth and +5 to attack.

Most people think so, thanks to folk stories and popular books on the subject of monsters. Drowners, like all necrophages, are creatures from another plane that came into this realm during the Conjunction of the Spheres many centuries ago. With no ecological niche here, they have become a plague upon the land.  Drowners prefer coastline, rivers, and marshy areas. They are amphibious and spend most of their time in the water. When they do come out it is usually to follow their stomachs: to grab something close to the water’s edge or search for food on land. When they find something to eat, they leap on it in a flurry of claws, attacking as a group and surrounding their pre y.\n                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                        A large group of drowners can be hellish to deal with. They overwhelm a single person by attacking in force and from all directions. They are immune to poison due to the horrible, murky, and toxic waters that they are used to, and it takes quite a bit to discourage them. However, they are also tremendously, staggeringly dumb. The few studies of drowners agree that they are about as intelligent as a predatory fish. They act completely on instinct, cannot in any way be reasoned with, and are even immune to spells that would mentally or emotionally affect them. This does mean that they never formulate plans more complex than ‘attack’ and they can be distracted by sufficiently shiny things as long as they haven’t  tasted blood. Drowners are also highly susceptible to fire it’s your best weapon.

Something about this family of monsters inspires the storyteller in everyone. Wyverns are draconids, in the same family as dragons but far from being dragons. They are violent, primal beasts that stalk high mountain areas and hunt people mostly when they happen upon them. Wyverns have no predisposition towards virgins–they pursue any living creature they think they can kill and eat. It is true that wyverns like to swoop down on their prey from above and try to stay in the air if possible. Unlike dragons, wyverns can’t breathe fire, but they can spit an acidic poison with great accuracy. That can make fighting a wyvern at range a daunting task. Luckily they aren’t immune to everything but silver. While their hides are tough to pierce, they can be felled with regular  steel  weapons and magic, just like most other creatures.\n                                                                                                                                                            When hunting a wyvern, start by preparing a draco-nid oil. Cover yourself from head to toe as much as possible to avoid acidic venom getting on any uncovered areas. Golden oriole potion is also a good idea, to negate poison effects. You should also stock up on ranged ammunition or make sure you know a few damaging spells. While a wyvern flies around its prey, a well-placed arrow or the like stands a good chance of knocking the monster out of the air, making it far easier to hit. While engaging a flying wyvern, be wary of their claws–they will try to slash at you as they fly by. On the ground a wyvern falls back to its fanged bite or the poisonous barbs on its tail.","monsterLoreSkillValue":16,"customStat":true,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+4","punch":{"value":"1d6+4"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+8"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/wyvern.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Wyvern","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/wyvern.png","tint":"","width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"nIrKH5ppDJZLz0bV","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NNReyuIQaB75K5zz","name":"Flight","type":"note","data":{"description":"The creature can take flight as a movement.

But the differences that do exist are very important, especially if you have to fight one of these brutes. Yes, all trolls are what most people consider stupid. They are about as smart as the average young child and remain that way their entire lives. They are also very fond of alcohol of any variety, though their mass means that it takes vodka and other spirits to really get them drunk. It’s not advisable to trick a troll when it comes to vodka–they are tremendously strong and don’t take well to being fooled. Trolls have tremendously power-ful punches which have been known to dent plate armor and crack even the most resilient shields, so dodging their attacks is preferable to trying to block and parrying is out of the question. Trolls of all varieties are very very accurate when it comes to lobbing boulders at distant targets. If you get too far from a troll you are currently fighting it will probably throw large rocks at you, forcing you to dodge and slow down until it can close the distance again. Trolls have also been known to grab and grapple targets, using their incredible strength to their ad-vantage.Now the differences. Don’t bother hiring rock trolls as builders—they’re useless. Rock trolls are smaller in stature than cave trolls, standing only two meters tall at most. However they are incredibly heavy, with a hard plate of rock on their back that acts as a natural shield against attacks from the rear.

These huge beasts look like a cross between humans and gigantic wolves. They are merciless monsters with no empathy and a powerful bloodlust. The worst part about these cursed beasts is that they arise from regular people. Werewolves manifest all the cruelty and evil intentions of the cursed person. When a person transforms into a werewolf, usually a process started by the rising of the moon, they lose all shreds of their humanity and are left with only their intelligence and their worst and most vicious urges. \n                                                                                                            These beasts are very difficult to fight, owing to their innate intelligence and regen-erative abilities, which only a moondust bomb can halt. Luckily, only a curse can create a werewolf—a bite from a werewolf will only cause you to bleed copiously. If you find yourself fighting a werewolf, skip all of the useless peasant cures and find a silver blade. Focus on dodging the werewolf ’s attacks and riposting with your silver blade or magic spells. Running from a werewolf is inadvisable—they are very quick and can track you through the harshest conditions by smell alone. If a friend has been afflicted with lycanthropy, it’s a good idea to tie them up at night until you can lift the curse.\n                                                                                                            While it can be difficult to determine what actions led to  any one case of lycanthropy, you can narrow it down.

You will die a horrible death. Contrary to popular belief, sirens have no magic to compel men to leap into the water and swim to them. They can only conceal their horrifying fishy features under those of beautiful young women—apparently enough for horny sailors who’ve been at sea for the past year. No, a siren lures a ship close with an attractive guise and then bursts into the air on scaly wings to swoop down on its prey. You can see how tying yourself to the mast may be a poor idea. \n                                                                                                                                                            A siren will swoop down from on high, swinging with its claws (or its tail if it’s feeling confident) before ascending again. Some will try to knock you into the water where their sisters can better tear you apart. Unfortunately, sirens in the air or in the water are very fast and very maneuverable, making them hard to catch or attack. Luckily you can knock a siren out of the air with a direct ranged weapon hit. In this time the siren is incredibly vulnerable and can usually be finished off  by two men with sturdy weapons. Technically, sirens are intelligent, and are capable of reason and diplomacy. That being said, they aren’t interested in it–they see all non-sirens as prey. It’s not entirely unheard of to encounter a siren willing to talk with you. In this case, be very wary: it might be trying to lure you into a trap. Still, old wives’ tales persist that sirens were once friendly. It’s just hard to tell whether these tales re-fer to the sirens we find off the coast now or a race that (like many others) was wiped out in the numerous race wars.","monsterLoreSkillValue":14,"customStat":false,"attackStats":{"meleeBonus":"+0","punch":{"value":"1d6+0"},"kick":{"value":"1d6+4"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/siren.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Sirens","displayName":0,"img":"systems/TheWitcherTRPG/assets/images/Monsters/tokens/siren.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"wmhrkLoVxdFlJzCk","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"vjFtPoZLBXhhoPsF","name":"Claws","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"S/P","isMelee":false,"accuracy":1,"avail":"Everywhere","damage":"2d6+2","reliable":0,"hands":"1","range":"","effect":"","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":1},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.29o7iAXQOVGA8xii"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"nazol51DfuL53l9v","name":"Tail","type":"weapon","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"","isMelee":false,"accuracy":0,"avail":"Everywhere","damage":"3d6+2","reliable":0,"hands":"1","range":"","effect":"","conceal":"Tiny","enhancements":0,"rateOfFire":1},"sort":200001,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"NEdIfwZu3AOOfIlF","name":"Siren Vocal Cords","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":65,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Sirens","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"sol"},"sort":300000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.d8RJYIr1LzJIIxps"}},"img":"sol.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"Sep0Fl5qBqofp3hx","name":"Essence of Water (2d6)","type":"component","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"cost":46,"type":"substances","rarity":"Rare","location":"Drowners & Sirens","quantityObtainable":"N/A","forage":"N/A","substanceType":"hydragenum"},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.4xDQhbstP7zyMVwR"}},"img":"hydragenum.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"aPZVdyTe5ikLm50O","name":"Mundane Item (1d6/3)","type":"valuable","data":{"description":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"cost":0,"type":"genera","avail":"Everywhere","effect":"","conceal":"Tiny","quality":""},"sort":200001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.rO4GvzOL1VPML8Rq"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"W5DtvTnqJZrEY2EO","name":"Vulnerability: Limited Movement","type":"note","data":{"description":"On land a siren has a REF, DEX & SPD of 2."},"sort":400000,"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"kIwwQsD6zeORvPnV","name":"Illusion","type":"note","data":{"description":"A siren is capable of instantly raising an illusion to make it look  like a beautiful woman with features of its choosing.
